This package implements the Bayesian network structure learning algorithms developed in [Huang and Zhou (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10994-022-06145-4), interfacing with the R package [bnlearn](https://www.bnlearn.com/). In particular, this package features the partitioned PC (pPC), $p$-value adjacency thresholding (PATH), and hybrid greedy initialization (HGI) algorithms, which culminate in the partitioned hybrid greedy search (pHGS) algorithm.



# Installation

Run the following code to install the package from GitHub.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jirehhuang/phsl")
```



# Usage

The pPC, PATH, and HGI algorithms are integrated into the `bnsl()` function, which is a mix-and-match Bayesian network structure learning function modeled after the `rsmax2()` function from the [bnlearn](https://www.bnlearn.com/) package. The pPC algorithm is available as a constraint-based algorithm in the `restrict` argument, PATH may be specified by the `path` argument when `restrict = "ppc"`, and HGI may be activated by the `hgi` argument for constraint-based and hybrid approaches. See `help(bnsl)` for more details and examples. Wrapper functions `ppc()` and `phgs()` contain presets to implement pPC with PATH and pHGS, respectively. 



# Scaling

Up to $1200$ copies of the [CANCER](https://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/discrete-small.html#cancer) network were tiled to obtain the 12 networks with numbers of nodes and edges shown in the following table.

|  $p$ | $\lvert{\mathbf E}\rvert$ |
|:----:|:-------------------------:|
|    5 |                         4 |
|   25 |                        27 |
|   50 |                        56 |
|  125 |                       140 |
|  250 |                       273 |
|  500 |                       558 |
| 1000 |                      1088 |
| 2000 |                      2249 |
| 3000 |                      3342 |
| 4000 |                      4467 |
| 5000 |                      5638 |
| 6000 |                      6653 |

Five datasets were generated for each network configuration with $n = 1000$ samples, and the following algorithms were executed on these datasets with `alpha = 0.05` and `max.sx = 3`. `bnlearn::pc.stable(...)` is the bnlearn implementation of PC(-stable), `phsl::ppc(..., max_groups = 1)` is the phsl version by executing pPC with $\kappa = 1$, and `phsl::ppc(...)` is the pPC algorithm. The timing results are shown in the following figure. 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("inst/figure/phsl_scale_pc_time.png")
```

While pPC and PC in phsl executed on the datasets with $p = 6000$ variables in approximately 80 minutes and 13 hours, respectively, the bnlearn implementation of PC struggled to execute on even 2000 variables, requiring over 50 hours, over 850 times slower than pPC.
